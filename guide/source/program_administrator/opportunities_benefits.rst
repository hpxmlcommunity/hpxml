Opportunities and Benefits for HPXML Adoption
#############################################

The HPXML was created to achieve some basic goals that are critical to a growing
industry:

#. Standardize terminology and facilitate the collection of higher quality
   data as a means to  track and quantify the work being completed across the
   residential energy-efficiency industry.
#. Create interoperability between software systems to allow the transfer of
   home performance data across a diverse set of market actors.
#. Improve industry efficiency by reducing the costs of data collection and
   exchange between market actors.

Once adopted, HPXML has the potential to dramatically lower costs in a wide
range of areas because software vendors can use off-the-shelf solutions that
they have already developed, rather than building new systems for each client.
If this is done in coordination with other HPXML jurisdiction, it can not only
lower operational costs, but give you access to a wide range of new
opportunities to help grow your local energy efficiency marketplace. While
these opportunities are expansive, it is important to remember that you don't
need to take advantage of every opportunity that HPXML creates. In fact, you
will need to identify your priorities and you will likely want to stage your
adoption of them over time.

To help understand what opportunities are available and encourage you to get the
most out of HPXML, we have identified several ideas at the trade ally, program,
and national levels for you to consider. These opportunities are as follows:

Trade Ally and Contractor Opportunities
***************************************

Participation in Home Performance or other energy-efficiency programs can help
contractors increase access to financing or incentives and align with marketing
and education efforts to promote their business. HPXML lets contracting
companies develop or procure systems that ease the burden of reporting to
programs, while improving the process for sales and customer engagement.  Some
of the opportunities for contractors include:

* **Reduce Data Collection Burden for Program Participation.** Many of the
  HPXML-compliant software tools offer contractors a more streamlined modeling
  or data collection experience.   The more that programs can align around both
  the use of HPXML and the data set required from jurisdiction to jurisdiction,
  the more makers of these tools can focus their investments to provide new and
  innovative functionality to improve the contractor experience and reduce the
  cost to use the tools.
* **Improved Sales Tools.** HPXML-compliant software tools offer a wide range
  of sales tools that can enable  contractors to offer a more customizable
  experience aligned with their customer's needs.  This can help increase
  conversion rates and assist in the sales process.
* **Acquiring New Investment Resources.** As better data on energy efficiency
  improvements is transparent and easily shared within the market, the
  opportunity to recruit new financing resources increases. This can help grow
  the market while reducing the dependency on program funding to facilitate
  that growth.

Program and Jurisdictional Opportunities
****************************************

Faster and more flexible tools can lower program costs, improve data quality,
and drive innovation into your program. The following are some of the
opportunities for HPXML that are being used by programs today:[WE SHOULD ADD SOMETHING ABOUR REDUCED ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS FOR BOTH THE CONTRACTOR AND THE PROG ADMIN.I HAVE SEEN THAT APS HAS ACTUAL DATA ON THE COST REDUCTION WHICH WOULD BE HELPFUL TO CONVEY HERE.]

* **Create an Open Modelling Software Market.**  You can use HPXML to allow
  participating contractors to choose  which software tool they want to use for
  energy models. By implementing HPXML, you can streamline the process for
  contractors to submit consistent information to the program using a variety
  of tools. This improves contractor satisfaction and reduces labor per project.
* **Adoption of Mobile Data Collection Apps.** The ability to collect data on
  a mobile device can save time and reduce reporting errors. By coding these
  apps to HPXML, you can export and store the data in a standardized format
  that aligns with national reporting requirements and can easily integrate
  with other software products.
* **Streamlined Quality Assurance.** As data becomes more standardized and
  consistent across multiple jurisdictions, software developers are creating
  more advanced QA systems to evaluate incoming data and guide quality
  assurance activities. The more automated desk reviews of projects for
  compliance with incentive and program rule become, the more you can maintain
  quality while reducing labor costs to manually review files. In some cases,
  automated approvals can allow contractors to seek incentive or financing
  approvals while they are still on-site with the customer.
* **Improved Program Analytics.** Improving both the quality and consistency
  of the data collected allows programs to complete comprehensive, ongoing
  analytics. HPXML data extracts can speed up or enhance measurement and
  evaluation efforts. Integrating HPXML data into marketing analytics can even
  help identify customers with a higher likelihood for savings or participation
  and provide new opportunities to use data to help grow your market.
* **Targeted or Trigger Based Marketing.**  HPXML can help programs capture
  details about a home's characteristics using online or in-field audit tools.
  This data can then be used to guide ongoing marketing investments by
  providing recommendations to customers that are most meaningful for their
  home and facilitate staging retrofit activities over time.
* **Export For Local Real Estate.** Working with your local real estate and
  appraisal networks, you can identify data points and export strategies that
  work for your market. This could include publishing completion certificates,
  providing the data to populate the Appraisal Institute's Green and Energy
  Efficient Addendum or direct export of data to your local MLS. By doing this,
  you can help increase the value of EE in the real estate transaction and
  provide greater incentive and investment opportunity for homeowners to fund
  energy efficiency retrofits. 

National Opportunities
**********************

Collecting standardized data sets across multiple jurisdictions is a critical
step in helping guide national policy, financial investments, and research.
With adoption of HPXML, you can command higher quality data and transfer that
data to a variety of actors in a cost-efficient manner:

* **Reporting to DOE or EPA Sponsored Programs.** Whether you are
  participating in Home Performance with ENERGY STAR, Low Income
  Weatherization, or as a EPA ENERGY STAR sponsor, HPXML can lower the cost and
  burden of data collection and reporting.
* **National Data Repositories.** Managed by federal agencies, trade ally
  associations, or other national organizations committed to the advancement of
  energy-efficiency investments, these repositories can organize data to track
  and quantify impacts of energy efficiency.
* **Coordination with Market Research.** National research efforts, whether
  lead by the Department of Energy, universities, industry organization, or
  private companies, have struggled to get consistent and reliable data from
  multiple jurisdictions. By adopting HPXML, you can more easily participate in
  these efforts and gain valuable insights into your program's performance and
  the opportunities for emerging technologies in your market.

Beyond data collection and reporting, there are a number of national efforts
that the interoperability of HPXML can facilitate. While there are new efforts
are emerging all the time, the following are some examples of current or
emerging opportunities:

* **DOE Home Energy Score.**  This allows homeowners to compare the energy
  performance of their homes to other homes nationwide. You can collect data in
  the field with an HPXML-compliant tool and transfer it to the DOE's
  application program interface (API) to generate a Home Energy Score in real
  time. This adds the value of the Home Energy Score to your program, while
  minimizing your integration cost. For more information about Home Energy
  Score or to get involved, go to
  http://energy.gov/eere/buildings/home-energy-score
* **EPA ENERGY STARÂ® Home Advisor.** You can create a profile of home energy
  efficiency features and get a prioritized, customized list of energy-saving
  recommendations. Programs that complete online or in-person energy audits
  with HPXML-compliant tools will be able to allow customers to upload their
  recommendations, track their progress over time, and receive other
  energy-saving information from the EPA. For more information go to
  https://www.energystar.gov/campaign/assessYourHome?fuseaction=home_energy_advisor.showgetinput
* **Multiple Listing Services.** Being able to accurately track energy
  efficiency improvements and make them known to potential homebuyers is a
  critical step in facilitating recognition of energy efficiency in the
  valuation of homes. The HPXML effort has been coordinated with Real Estate
  Transaction Standard (RETS), which is a national data standard from the
  `Real Estate Standards Organization <http://www.reso.org>`_. The multiple
  listing services, which represent the backbone of that real estate
  information industry, use RETS to maintain consistent data. For more
  information, visit

These are several of the recognized opportunities that have emerged to date. 
While others are being created all the time, it is important to pick those that
are most relevant to your jurisdiction and incorporate them into your
implementation plan as described in the next section of this document.
